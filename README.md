# Spaceship-Titanic-Project-
Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Rescue Mission, a data science project aimed at solving the cosmic mystery surrounding the unfortunate collision of the interstellar passenger liner, Spaceship Titanic. Launched just a month ago with nearly 13,000 passengers on board, the vessel was on its maiden voyage to transport emigrants from our solar system to three newly habitable exoplanets.

Tragically, while navigating the Alpha Centauri system en route to the torrid 55 Cancri E, Spaceship Titanic collided with a concealed spacetime anomaly within a dust cloud. Miraculously, the ship remained intact, but almost half of the passengers were mysteriously transported to an alternate dimension.

In a race against time, our mission is to leverage advanced data science skills to predict and identify the passengers who were affected by the anomaly. By analyzing the records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system, we aim to assist the rescue crews in pinpointing those lost in the alternate dimension and bring them back to safety.

Project Goals:
Data Recovery and Cleaning: Extract, clean, and organize the data retrieved from the damaged computer system of Spaceship Titanic.

Anomaly Identification: Utilize machine learning algorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and anomalies in the passenger records, helping distinguish those affected by the spacetime anomaly.

Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast which passengers are likely to have been transported to the alternate dimension based on various factors such as location, passenger type, and onboard activities.

Collaboration and Open Source: Foster collaboration among data scientists, researchers, and enthusiasts to collectively contribute to the rescue mission. This GitHub repository serves as a central hub for sharing code, insights, and findings.

Visualizations and Reports: Create informative visualizations and reports to communicate the results of the analysis, aiding rescue crews in their mission to retrieve the lost passengers.

By combining the power of data science with interstellar exploration, this project strives to rewrite history and rescue the misplaced passengers of Spaceship Titanic. Join us on this thrilling journey to unravel the cosmic mystery and make a difference in the vastness of space! Together, let's bring our lost travelers back home.
